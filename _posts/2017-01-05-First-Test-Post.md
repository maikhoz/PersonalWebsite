I've never done markdown languages before, so this should be pretty interesting.

Let's see how cool I can make this post and talk about some of the stuff on my About page...

In terms of video games, _Stardew Valley_ is my game of the year. The endless content in the game challenges you to mini-max your way to the end game through farming, but it's the little things like villager interactions/relationships and the dungeon crawling that keep you wanting to go just one more day.

I recently saw the film, _Manchester By The Sea_, and it is **phenomenal**. It can be a slow movie at times, but Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams put in amazing performances. If I had to sum it up in a few words, "devastatingly haunting" would be succinct.

As I'm writing this, I'm currently in bed, listening to a video game music playlist from my Spotify that you can check out [here][spotify-videogame]!

In terms of food recipes... I enjoyed this [one-pot pasta orzo dish][recipe-link] that is pretty easy and pretty delicious! I tried it without the ricotta cheese at the end and it was still delicious.

For MMA, I'm a white-belt in terms of exposure to it, but man is it exhilarating. I got into the sport when I heard this random Irish dude by the name of Conor McGregor trash talk people and I've been hooked ever since.

As a Los Angeles native, it's hard not to watch basketball and not be a Lakers fan. We're in a strut this year, but that's to be expected with our young guys at the helm.

Just to see how code snippets work in Markdown, here's a test
{% highlight ruby %}
import maikho

def main():
  while maikho.coolness is True:
    doCoolStuff()

#=> I'm always cool and I do cool stuff.

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
{% endhighlight %}
