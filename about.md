Hello mysterious wanderers of the internet! I'm Michael, just trying some stuff out for the break! Currently a student majoring in Computer Science.

### More Information

When I'm not trying to learn things on the Internet, I'm enjoying video games, attempting being a film buff, making random Spotify playlists, trying out new food recipes, being enamored with MMA, and representing Purple and Gold (Go Lakers!). If you're interested in any of those (or even not!), come by and say hello!
